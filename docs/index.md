# Malaria Detection

### Using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks to creat a computer vision model to cost effectively detect maaria


## By James Hochleutner


```markdown


- Malaria is a deadly disease that is transmitted by infected mosquitos in predominantly warmer climates
- CDC estimates 400,000 people die of malaria annually
- Traditional Malaria Detection requires examination of individual samples by trained labratory professionals
- many types ofo highly effective antimalaria medications are avaliable for treatment once patients are diagnosed
- Low Cost, fast, and scalable detection could significantly reduce malaria mortality
- By training a computer to detect malaria from the image of a red blood cell, we can elliminate the need for a trained lab technician in the diagnosis process
