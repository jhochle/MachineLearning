# Malaria Detection

### Using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks to creat a computer vision model to cost effectively detect maaria


## By James Hochleutner


```markdown


- Malaria is a deadly disease that is transmitted by infected mosquitos.
- CDC estimates 400,000 people die of malaria annually.
- Traditional Malaria Detection requires examination of samples by trained labratory professionals
- Many types fo highly effective antimalaria medications are avaliable for treatment
- Low Cost, fast, and scalable detection could significantly reduce malaria mortality
- Using a computer vision model we can elliminate the need for a trained lab technician
- Final model trained using a 14 layer Convolutional Neural Network achieved 98.8% accuracy
